Going for interview, he is called into another office where they are expecting John Benjamin, a strict prison governor recently arrived from Australia who is applying for the vacancy at Blakedown Prison in Devon. On the way to what Twist believes is the school, he becomes drunk, and on arrival is mistaken for Max Slessor, a prisoner who had escaped during a jailbreak. Designated Convict 99 and in for seven years for forgery, Twist is soon discovered to be the new Prison Governor, and once put in his  rightful place embarks on a programme to make the prison a more friendly place for the prisoners, funding it from the proceeds of a football pools win and stock market investments. Things take a turn for the worse, when the recaptured Slessor, aided by a phoney baroness who accuses Twist of attempted rape, escapes again with a signed cheque. Altering the figures, he draws the entire prison funds from the bank. Twist and some of the convicts head in a prison van to Limehouse, in east London, to catch Slessor, recover the lost funds and then successfully break into the bank in the middle of the night to return the money.\n"

            " The film takes place in the year 1750 on the American frontier during the colonial days, before the United States declared its independence. A group of pioneers narrowly escape persecution when their preacher is accused of adultery and polygamy. The preacher, Will Smythe, is accused of having an affair with a married woman, Eloise Dalton whose husband is away hunting for food, and another woman, Leah, who is insane. Also among their group is Eloise's daughter Fanny Dalton, the couple Jewell Buchanan and Margaret Buchanan along with their daughter Cathleen, Calvin and his wife who goes by the name Sister, and their granddaughter Meg. As the group travels farther away from their town, the threat of attack from hostile Native American tribes becomes more prevalent until the group is eventually ambushed. Calvin does not survive the attack, but the others are protected by Leah, who has used witchcraft to provide their protection. All the while the others are unaware that Leah is using magic the keep them safe. The remaining members of the group are forced to abandon their trail along the riverbank, and take cover in the woods far from man made trails. At this time, Eloise's husband Marion Dalton returns home to find news that his wife was scheduled to be executed along with Will for affair and also learns that the two are on the run with others from the town. Marion pursues and eventually catches up to them. Leah wanders away from the group for a short while. By this time the Shawnee Indians have caught up to the group and Marion Dalton, who speaks fluently in many tribal languages, is able to convince the Shawnee to abort the attack, at lest for a short while, though Marion is certain the Shawnee will be back in bigger numbers. Leah returns covered in white feathers and Marion recognizes this as a warning from the Shawnee Indians to other members of the Shawnee tribe not to enter a nearby valley. Realizing that the Shawnee have superstitions about the valley, Marion leads the group into the valley, knowing that if the Shawnee were to return, they would not follow the pioneers into the valley because of various Native American superstition some of the tribes have in regards to this particular valley. Once the group settles in the deserted valley, they are safe from any and all tribes of Native Americans. Though the pioneers are no longer under the threat of attack from the Shawnee, they find a young Native American orphan on the outskirts of their camp. The pioneers are still unnerved by the previous attacks, but reluctantly bring the girl into the camp and care for her. It seems that only Will is pleased with the orphan's unexpected appearance, and he is delighted at the possibility of baptizing her into Christianity. Aside from Will, it seems the others in the group are unnerved by the orphan girl's presence. And Leah, who has an extraordinary connection to the supernatural, senses that there is something unusual about the Native American child, and Leah soon begins to have visions as she tries to uncover the motives of the orphan girl. Fanny disappears soon afterward, and her body is later found by Marion, with the help of Leah through her abilities and visions, though Fanny appears to be in a coma. Only when Fanny awakens do they realize that the warnings to stay away from the valley are founded on more than just mythology, coupled with the frightening revelation that the orphan girl is more than what she seems when the group is terrorized by an evil spirit that desires to make them all its living captives. \n",

            " Richard, the duke of Gloucester , is dismayed when his dying brother King Edward IV names their brother George, Duke of Clarence as Protector to his young son and heir, Prince Edward. Richard wants the position himself, to become de facto ruler after his brother's death. He secretly stabs George to death with a dagger bearing the crest of the Woodville family, framing the dying king's in-laws. Richard is now named Protector. His wife Anne approves of his crime and encourages him to take the throne for himself. After the death of King Edward, Richard tries to achieve his ends by intimidating the widowed queen's lady-in-waiting Mistress Shore into claiming that the dead king's two children are illegitimate. She refuses, and Richard tortures her. After she dies on the rack, Richard claims he executed her for spreading the rumour that the princes were illegitimate. He says that the two princes should be placed in his protective custody. The ghosts of Clarence, King Edward and Mistress Shore haunt Richard, warning him that they will be revenged at \"Bosworth\". He is also told that he will be killed by a dead man. Shore's ghost merges with the body of Anne, and a semi-deranged Richard strangles his own wife, believing her to be Shore. Without his beloved Anne, he is struck with guilt and loneliness. Richard consults the Moorish physician and sorcerer Tyrus, who shows him visions of his future, including the prophecy that he will be king. Tyrus is disturbed by Richard's increasingly deranged demeanour. Fearful for the safety of the princes, he informs Sir Jasper, a young aristocrat who is looking after the lads. Jasper plots with his girlfriend, Lady Margaret, to rescue the princes. He manages to get the young Duke of York and his mother free, but he is trapped and captured with the child-king Edward. Lady Margaret, who has been sent to get aid from her father Lord Stanley, is also captured and imprisoned. Richard spares Jasper, because he needs him to negotiate with Stanley, who is witholding his support for the Protector. Richard forces the Archbishop to give up the Duke of York, who has sought church sanctuary in Westminster Abbey with his mother. Aided by his crony, Sir Ratcliffe, Richard then murders the two princes in their beds and proclaims himself king. The ghosts of the princes try to lure Richard to his death from the battlements of the Tower, but he is saved by Buckingham. Buckingham confides in Ratcliffe his doubts about Richard's sanity, suggesting that they should join Lord Stanley. Ratcliffe informs Richard, who has Buckingham tortured to death. Meanwhile, Tyrus helps Jasper to rescue Margaret, but is mortally wounded during the escape. Jasper and Margaret join Stanley to encourage him to topple Richard from the throne. Richard is crowned, but is still haunted by fear. Ratcliffe informs him that Stanley has marched to the village of Bosworth with an army. Richard declares that he will fight. When Ratcliffe learns that Stanley has been joined by the Earl of Richmond, he advises Richard to flee, but the king is convinced of his invincibility. At the Battle of Bosworth Field Richard is eventually left alone on the battlefield after his army has been defeated. The ghosts of his victims appear, and he attempts to fight them. Jasper, Stanley and Richmond watch as Richard swipes at thin air. The king attempts to mount a horse, but is thrown and killed by a battleaxe held by a dead soldier. \n",

            " At Fallbrook Middle School, the annual student-elected Teacher of the Year award ceremony is held. Every year for the last 43 years, Norman Warner, fondly called Stormin' Norman, has won the award. During the ceremony, he collapses and dies. The burden of carrying the legacy falls to Matt Warner, son of the late Norman Warner who has always lived in the shadow of his father. Determined to keep the family tradition of being Teacher of the Year alive, Matt focuses all his attention and efforts in winning the coveted title. But the new history teacher, Mr. Michael D'Angelo becomes the new student favorite. He is called, even by fellow and senior teachers, \"Mr. D\". Young, funny, with unconventional methods of teaching and an uncanny ability to connect with his students, Mr. D. quickly wins the hearts not only of the students but also the teachers, especially the young art teacher, Ms. Davies. Now that Mr. D. is the most popular teacher on campus, Matt feels that he has no chances of winning against Mr. D. Now obsessed with discrediting Mr. D, Matt soon forgets what it means to be a teacher. Desperate to find a flaw in \"Mr Perfect\", Matt follows Mr. D around town and discovers a secret the alarmingly perfect teacher is hiding: Mr. D has been diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer and does not have long to live. Shocked by the startling discovery into realizing his own pettiness, Matt slowly changes his ways of teaching and in the process wins the hearts of his students. When Mr. D stops coming to teach because of his worsening illness, the students become depressed by the situation. Matt steps in to cheer up the student's spirits and leads the basketball team to a victory with a special guest appearance with 30 seconds left in the game by Mr. D. The film concludes after three years have passed and Matt's own son is now in high school, and Matt is teaching a brand new year of pupils in his life science class. He has won the Teacher of the Year for the last two years, Mr. D having won the award in the school year of 2003. The art teacher, Ms. Davies, inherited Mr. D's car. The film ends with a close-up of a photo in Matt's classroom of himself, Mr. D, and the basketball team with \"Michael D'Angelo 1967-2003\" inscribed on the bottom of the frame. \n",

            " Qiu Ju is a peasant who lives in a small farming enclave with her husband Qinglai, his sister and their father. She is in the final trimester of her first pregnancy. One day while her husband is conversing to Wang Shantang, the head of the community, a miscommunication ensues. Qinglai's comment that Shantang \"only breeds hens\", was misconstrued to reflect on a perceived inability of the chieftain to produce a son . The minor municipality leader is insulted by this inference and beats Qinglai, kicking him so severely in the groin that he must see a doctor and remain absent from his work. Because of this injustice, Qiu Ju sets forth to extract an explanation from Wang Shantang, one which the village head is unwilling to supply. Qiu Ju, determined to right this wrong, goes to the local police office and complains. The policeman for their area comes up with a solution: the village chief must pay 200 yuan to Qinglai. When Qiu Ju goes to the headman, he insultingly throws the 200 yuan notes onto the ground and refuses to apologize. Qiu Ju then goes to the provincial capital accompanied by her husbands' younger sister, Meizi. To raise money for the trip she sells some of the dried hot peppers which are produced on the family farm for cash. This process is one that she and Meizi repeat several times more. Taking the bus to the big city she and her sister are obviously \"country folk\" as the city people are dressed in a more modern fashion. By luck the two women find lodging at a cheap hotel where the manager helps them by giving them the address of the head of the district police. The two women meet him and he promises them that their case will be reviewed. Weeks later the new verdict from the district police is nearly the same as the previous, but this time the village headman must pay 250 yuan. He still refuses to apologize and so Qiu Ju goes back to the big city, this time against the wishes of her own husband . Qiu Ju finds a lawyer who takes the case and files suit under a new law. The case is judged by the court as having been correctly resolved in by the district, the fine remains at 250 yuan, Qiu Ju is unhappy but all she can do is make yet another appeal to an even higher level of police investigation. As part of the suit, officials come to the village and Qiu Ju's husband is X-rayed at the local hospital. Its now the middle of winter, Qiu Ju goes into labor and experiences complications. The village headman is woken at night by Qiu Ju's husband's father who begs the village chief to do something. Grumbling, he sets off in the night, through the snow, rounds up a group of local men , and returns to the village. They then carry Qiu Ju, by hand, on a stretcher through the snow to the hospital, where she gives birth safely to a healthy baby boy. A month later the whole village is invited to the \"one month party\" for the baby boy and the village headman is begged to come to the party as Qiu Ju and her husband all admit that the village chief saved Qiu Ju's life. But he doesn't come, and the local policeman shows up to tell Qiu Ju that the X-rays revealed her husband had a broken rib. As a result, the village chief is being sent to jail on a fifteen-day-term. Qiu Ju, runs off to try and stop the police from taking the headman away but never even sees the police and the movie ends on a freeze-frame of Qiu Ju with an expression of anguish on her face. \n",

            " Benny Fikus decides to cash in on his business' fire insurance by committing arson. Benny plans to have Sherman, who is in a mental hospital believing that World War II is still being fought, escape and burn down Benny's failing clothing store which he has made Sherman believe is a Nazi military headquarters. During a vacation trip with Marion, Benny has a heart attack, and his sons Ezra and Russel take over the store. The low self-esteemed Russell wants to expand the store and marry his girlfriend, while Ezra needs money to adopt an orphaned 6'8\" African-American teenage boy named Booker T . Ezra needs Booker T. to play on the high-school basketball team he coaches because he has won a total of two games in seven years as a coach and is in danger of losing his job. Russell discovers that his father is bankrupt, with his only asset being the surrender value on the store's fire insurance policy. Russell cashes in the policy and splits it with Ezra, using the money to buy more stock. Back at home, Benny is practically comatose after his heart attack. An \"in denial\" Marion is told by house painters helping with a home redecoration project that her husband is \"very sick\" which she interprets as Benny being already dead. She then decides to change redecoration plans to prepare for funeral services. Meanwhile, Sherman has escaped and is on his way to burn down the \"Nazi Headquarters\" . Benny recovers from his heart attack, and informs Russell that Sherman is on his way to burn down the store so they can collect the fire insurance that they no longer have. Hilarity ensues as Ezra has his wife run his basketball team while he and Russell attempt to stop Sherman from his quest to fight the Huns by any means necessary. \n",

            " The film begins with three separate teams accusing the same man of marrying one among them and making off with all their wealth. The police term it the Manmatha Raja case, and it receives wide media coverage. A man's likeness is also broadcasted. Upon seeing that, two more girls realize that they have also been cheated by the same man, but are unwilling to believe it. On a separate track, Panchamruta aka Panche  is travelling in a bus. The bus meets with an accident and Panche is admitted to the hospital. A policeman ties Panche's face to that of the accused in the Manmatha Raja case and Panche is arrested. Panche's case receives widespread attention, and it finally comes before the judge . The judge's daughter Pooja , a law student who's one of the girls cheated by Manmatha, obtains permission to watch the proceedings. The judge or judge-amma as Panche begins to call her, begins the proceedings by offering a court appointed lawyer for Panche's defense. Panche refuses, and says he will represent himself. The first witness in court is Rekha Vijay Mittal . She recounts, she found a mobile at a parking lot which turns out to belong to Vijay Mittal . Vijay talks to her in English, and asks her to hang on to the mobile, as he's flying to London. Rekha, impressed by him and his wealth, agrees. Vijay comes to Bangalore, and meets Rekha and her brother. Her brother is in the construction business and wants Vijay to help him move things with a strict politician. Vijay says that the politician expects 25 lakhs in bribes in a briefcase and call it a file. They do so, and the politician who is unaware of the existence of the bribe money, takes it. Rekha wants to marry Vijay, but according to his friend Johnny Walker , he has prior commitments to marry an Englishwoman. Vijay however agrees to a quick wedding, and they get married. Vijay doesn't let them get photographed either. The next day, Vijay has run away from the house taking all the valuables with him. The money they had given to the politician is also gone, as Vijay has changed briefcases soon after. Rekha now says that Panche is Vijay Mittal. Panche argues that she has no proof at all that a wedding happened. He also suggests that the judge jails Rekha's brother on bribery charges as they have publicly accepted it. The public prosecutor has no choice but to accept Panche's arguments. In the mean time, Pooja is quite impressed with the arguments of Panche. She tells him so when he is being taken away, and she tells him that she knows that he is not Panche but Zakir Hussain , who cheated her out of a painting she paid one lakh for. Panche disagrees strongly. The next witness is the Telugu girl Shanti/Telugu Pilla/Bangaru . Shanti is obsessed with films, and she in uninterested in the man she is engaged to marry as he isn't heroic enough. She once meets a man wearing the Krissh face mask, and riding a bike on a single tyre. She is impressed with his heroism. He tells her his name is Khush  and he gives her his mobile so she can contact him. Johnny Walker calls her instead, and lets her know that he's really Samarasimha Reddy, hailing from a Rayala Seema royal family and in filmy style has got rid of all his enemies. This impresses her further and she runs away with him with all her valuables. He builds a shack for them in Dil style, and marries her by exchanging flower garlands. Just when they're about to have their nuptials, he makes off with all the gold she's brought with her. In a fit of anger, Shanti has thrown away the mangalasutra he tied her. Now she accuses that Samarasimha Reddy is in fact Panche. Panche says he is not, and says that even this girl has no proof to accuse him and that the story itself was like a combination of four films. Shanti is extremely irritated, but she has no choice but to step down. In the meantime, a man named David Fernandes Shridhar claims that Panche is really his brother Joseph . David had a failed marriage, and his wife, who is frustrated with David's poverty leaves with another man. Deeply affected by that Joseph takes to crime and unjust behaviour, and substantiates all his doings with unarguable logic. And one day, David gets irritated enough with Joseph that he throws him out of the house. Panche listens to all this and disagrees. He says he was born and brought up a Hindu, and also says that he is from Mangalore. The police find that the story he has told them about his mother is true. A DNA test between David and Panche comes back negative. The fourth witness is Radha Bai  who claims that Panche deceived them in the guise of Shri Shri Bhagwan Rajneesh . He calls himself an incarnation of Lord Krishna, and has come to the ashram of Radha Bai to marry Rani , her daughter and take her to heaven. Under the influence of the drugs he has fed them in the name of theertha, both Radha bai and Rani happily agree. He plies them with enough ramarasa for them to lose senses, and makes off with all their money. Panche ridicules them for their foolishness and also makes fun of the fact that Rani wanted to get married to a god. The public prosecutor has no counter-arguments here either. In the meantime, the police find Johnny Walker. Johnny says that he was bribed by a man like Panche to call all the women in question, but he is unable to convincingly tell them that Panche was indeed the man. The last witness is the industrialist Monica , who says she had a secretary called Shyam Prasad , who helped her realize that she was missing something without a marriage. She was a divorcee, divorced from her husband because she was a self-satisfied woman. She falls for Shyam and even announces their wedding, but Shyam walks away. She talks for Panche, and says he shouldn't be jailed. The judge listens to all these arguments and says that she has nothing on Panche, so he is free to go. Panche leaves, and men with the likeness of Shyam, Samarasimha, Rajneesh, Vijay who're present in the crowd also leave and everyone follows them. But, it turns out that these are all different men, all related to the girls, wearing wigs. And Panche is really David's brother Joseph who has been playacting with the girls to make them realize their mistakes and accept the men  who love them. He explains that after he left David's house, he found that his sister in law committed suicide. He then decides to help these women by making them realize that their greed for different things is foolish. Along with the end credits, we are shown how Panche/Joseph falsified various evidences like the DNA sample. \n",

Much to Alan's dismay, they are joined by Lauren's younger brother, Teddy. During Lauren's father's toast, he shows his disapproval of Stu by comparing him to congee. At the end of the night, Stu hesitantly joins Phil, Doug, Alan and Teddy for a beer. Sitting at a campfire and roasting marshmallows, the group toast to Stu and Lauren's future happiness. The following morning, Phil, Stu and Alan, along with flamboyant gangster Leslie Chow - whom Alan befriended after Las Vegas - and a chain-smoking capuchin monkey, awaken in a dirty hotel room in Bangkok. Stu has a face tattoo , and Alan's head is completely shaved. However, they cannot find Teddy, only discovering his severed finger. Chow begins recalling the events of the prior night, but he seemingly dies after snorting a line of cocaine. Panicked, the trio dispose of Chow's body in an ice box. Through a tip from Doug who is still at the resort, they go to a prison to pick up Teddy but are given a wheelchair-bound elderly Buddhist monk, who knows more about what happened, but does not reveal anything: he has taken a vow of silence, and rejects also an alternative such as writing something down. After finding a business card, they travel to a neighborhood smouldering in ruins. They enter a nearby tattoo parlor where Stu got his tattoo, and they learn that they had started a fight that escalated into a riot. The trio then return the monk to his Buddhist temple, where they are encouraged by the head monk to meditate. Alan is able to recall that they had been at a strip club. There, they learn that Stu had engaged in sex with a kathoey prostitute. Upon exiting, the trio is attacked by two Russian mobsters from whom they had stolen the monkey, and Phil is shot in the arm. After Phil is treated at a clinic, Alan confesses that he had drugged some of the marshmallows from the previous night with muscle relaxants and ADHD medication in order to sedate Teddy but accidentally mixed up the bags. After noticing an address and time point for a meeting written on Alan's stomach, the trio meet up with another gangster, Kingsley, who demands Chow's bank account code and password by the next morning in exchange for Teddy. They return to the hotel to try to find Chow's password, only to discover that he is still alive. They steal the monkey  back from the Russian mobsters through a violent car chase, during which the monkey is shot and injured. After taking the code and leaving the monkey at a veterinary clinic, the group complete the deal with Kingsley. Suddenly, Interpol agents appear and arrest Chow. Kingsley turns out to be an undercover agent, who tells the trio that the police had used the information that Teddy had disappeared to arrest Chow and Kingsley actually does not know where Teddy is. Desperate and out of clues, Phil once again calls Doug's wife Tracy. Stu then has an epiphany and the trio rushes back to the hotel and find Teddy in the elevator unharmed . Teddy had woken up in the middle of the night to get more ice for his severed finger  but became trapped after the power went out. The four use Chow's speedboat, the keys for which were in Teddy's pocket, to travel back to the wedding reception. Arriving on land just as Lauren's father is about to cancel the wedding, Stu makes a defiant speech where he rejects being boring and instead states that he is in fact quite wild. Impressed, Lauren's father gives the couple his blessing. After the wedding continues on, Alan presents Stu with a special gift at the post-reception dance: a musical guest performance by Mike Tyson. Teddy later discovers that he had taken many pictures during the night on his cell phone. The group, along with Tyson, agree to look at the pictures together once before erasing the evidence of their exploits once again. \n",

            " The film opens with shots showing Veeraiya ([[Vikram  jumping off a cliff into water. His gang is busy distracting the police. Police vehicles are set ablaze and women seduce policemen into a trap whereby Veera's henchmen attack. The police are ruthlessly murdered. Raagini , whilst on a boating trip, is kidnapped by Veera. Dev Prakash , her husband and a senior police officer, is informed of the incident. A brief montage of sorts showcases the story of Veeraiyya. He is seen as a local hero, who runs a parallel govt in areas near Tirunelveli, with his brothers — Singarasu  and Sakkarai ([[Munna . Though considered a terrorist by the local police, Veeraiyya is respected by the villagers. He kidnaps Raagini hoping to avenge the death of his sister Vennila . He brings her to the edge of a cliff to shoot her to death. She refuses to die at his hands and jumps off the cliff into the water far below, hoping to kill herself, but fails to do so. This causes Veera to hold off the murder, being unable to kill someone who has no fear of death. Dev and his team enter the forests with the aid of Gnanaprakasam , a local forest guard. Gnanaprakasam plays the role of Hanuman from the traditional epic. Despite searching deep in the forests, Dev is unable to hunt down Veera. Meanwhile, Raagini develops feelings for Veera after she hears the story of his sister's death. Dev had led an encounter against Veera during Vennila's wedding. Dev's shot grazes Veera in the neck. Veera, fighting for his life, is unable to protect his sister, and he is led out of the fiasco by his gang. The police pressurize Vennila into revealing Veera's hideout. When she refuses, she is subjected to physical and sexual assault. Veera returns home to find Vennila distraught and traumatised. The next day, she commits suicide by drowning in a nearby well. Unhappy with the way his brother is leading a war causing distress to his gang, Sakkarai offers a truce to Dev. Dev initially seems to agree but, when Sakkarai comes out in the open, Dev shoots him to death — revealing that he considers the destruction of Veera as more important than saving his wife. Veera and Singarasu are enraged and attack Dev's camp; they wipe it out completely. A final confrontation between Veera and Dev takes place on a rickety bridge — where Veera triumphs over Dev — when he decides not to let Dev die. He tells Dev he is letting him live because of his wife. Dev manages to extricate himself out and finds Raagini bound and tied up — with Veera leaving her. Dev is not entirely happy and, while returning to their hometown of Mettukudi, he accuses Raagini of infidelity and informs her that it was Veera who told him so. Furious, Raagini leaves Dev to meet Veera through Singarasu. She manages to meet him and asks him why he had accused her. Veera tells her he said that he had protected Raagini safely for the fourteen days and nothing else. He quickly realizes that Dev lied, hoping Raagini would lead him to his hideout. Dev appears with a police team and confront the duo. Raagini tries to save Veera, but he pushes her out of the line of fire. He is shot multiple times, whereby he falls off the cliff. The touching climax of the movie shows Raagini's true feelings coming to surface: She is seen trying with all her might to save Veera. Although Veera tries to grab her hand amidst the gun fire, he fails to do so, dying without touching Raagini throughout the time he knew her.  Veera, content that Raagini has feelings for him, falls to his death with a smile. \n",

            "  High-school senior Peter Parker  lives in Forest Hills, a quiet suburban neighborhood in the New York City borough of Queens, with his Uncle Ben  and Aunt May . He secretly loves Mary Jane Watson , a warm-hearted girl next door, but is too shy to approach her. His best friend Harry Osborn  is the son of Dr. Norman Osborn , president of the Oscorp manufacturing corporation, which is working to win a contract to supply weapons to the United States Army.  On a field trip to a genetics laboratory, Peter is bitten by a genetically engineered spider. He passes out in his bedroom at home, and wakes to find that his vision is perfect, he has developed superhuman strength, his wrists emit web strings, and his reflexes are super-quick. At school, he saves Mary Jane from a split-second fall and easily defeats her bullying boyfriend Flash Thompson  in a fistfight. Realizing that the spider's bite has given him spider-like powers, he trains himself to scale walls, jump between rooftops, and swing through the city. Peter enters a wrestling tournament, hoping to win $3,000 so he can buy a sports car to impress Mary Jane. On the day of the tournament, Ben gives Peter some fatherly advice, most importantly the message \"with great power comes great responsibility\", but Peter lashes out at him. Peter easily defeats his opponent, Bonesaw McGraw , but the fight promoter only gives Peter $100 for winning a match 1 minute earlier than he had to. When a thief robs the man, Peter takes his revenge by allowing the robber to escape. Later that night, Peter finds that his Uncle Ben has been shot by a carjacker. As his uncle dies, Peter learns of the thief's whereabouts through the police radios and pursues him using his powers. Peter catches up with the thief, only to discover that it was the man who robbed the wrestling arena earlier. Feeling responsible for Ben's death, and guilty for rejecting his advice, Peter dedicates himself to fighting crime as Spider-Man. He makes money by selling pictures of himself as Spider-Man to Daily Bugle newspaper editor J. Jonah Jameson , who declares Spider-Man a menace to New York. Meanwhile, under pressure from the military, Norman tests Oscorp's dangerous new performance-enhancing chemical on himself. The chemical manages to make him much stronger, but he quickly develops a maniacal alter ego, and immediately murders his assistant. Later, he has no recollection of the murder, and learns that a piece of Oscorp hardware, a small flying weapons platform called a \"glider\", along with a special suit to control it, were stolen. Soon afterwards, a costumed figure armed with the suit and glider attacks, killing the military liaison that pressured Norman, as well as several scientists working for Quest Aerospace, a competitor for Oscorp, allowing Oscorp to become the main supplier to the U.S. Army. Norman proudly announces this to Oscorp's board of directors, only to become enraged when told that they have fired him in lieu of a merger deal they've accepted with Quest Aerospace. At an Oscorp-sponsored fair, the same costumed figure attacks again, killing the directors. He almost kills Mary Jane, but Spider-Man manages to drive him away. After being saved by the superhero, Mary Jane begins to develop a crush on him and also becomes weary of her relationship with Harry. Jameson dubs Norman's alter ego the \"Green Goblin\". After Spider-Man refuses the Goblin's offer to work together, Norman secretly discovers that Peter is Spider-Man. The Green Goblin attacks Aunt May's house, hosplitazing her. As they watch over May in the hospital, Mary Jane tells Peter she loves Spider-Man, and Peter expresses his own feelings for her. Harry sees them holding hands, and in an act of jealousy tells his father about their love for each other, revealing that Peter has feelings for Mary Jane. The Goblin lures Spider-Man to the top of the Queensboro Bridge by taking Mary Jane and a Roosevelt Island Tramway car full of children hostage. As he drops both Mary Jane and the children, the Goblin commands Spider-Man to choose which one he will save. Acting quickly, however, Spider-Man saves them both, with help from the people on the bridge and a barge on the river below, forcing the Goblin to take Spider-Man to an abandoned atrium. In a final battle, Spider-Man defeats the Green Goblin, forcing Norman to reveal himself. Norman tells Peter he tried to stop the violence the \"Goblin\" had caused. However, Norman attempts to kill Peter by sending his glider flying towards him but Peter dodges it, causing it to impale Norman. Norman tells Peter not to reveal his true identity to Harry, then dies. Spider-Man removes the Goblin suit from Norman's body and then drops him at the Osborn's penthouse, but is spotted by Harry, who is left with the impression that Spider-Man murdered his father. At Norman's funeral, Harry swears to Peter that he will make Spider-Man pay dearly and avenge his father's death. Mary Jane confesses her love to Peter and kisses him, but Peter insists that they can only be friends, with him afraid that she would suffer further harm if Spider-Man's enemies knew that he loved her. Walking away from Mary Jane, who is now in tears yet also finds the kiss familiar afterward, he recalls Ben's words, \"With great power comes great responsibility,\" and accepts his new life as Spider-Man. \n",

            "  In the 1930's, James Henry Trotter is a young boy who lives with his parents by the sea in the United Kingdom. On James's birthday, they plan to go to New York City and visit the Empire State Building, the tallest building in the world. However, his parents are later killed by a ghostly rhinoceros from the sky and finds himself living with his two cruel aunts, Spiker and Sponge. He is forced to work all day and they threaten him with beatings to keep him in line and taunt him about the mysterious rhino and other hazards if he tries to leave. While rescuing a spider from being squashed by his aunts, James meets a mysterious man with a bag of magic green \"crocodile tongues\", which he gives to James to make his life better. The soldier warns him not to lose the \"tongues\" and disappears. When James is returning to the house, he trips and the \"tongues\" escape into the ground. One peach is soon found on a withered old tree, and grows into immense proportions. Spiker and Sponge use the giant peach as an attraction, making lots of money as James watches from the house, not allowed to leave. That night, James is sent to pick up the garbage. While doing so, he grabs a chunk of the peach to eat as one of the \"crocodile tongues\" jumps into it. A large hole appears inside the peach and James crawls inside, where he finds and befriends a group of life-size anthropomorphic bugs who also dream of an ideal home . As they hear the aunts search for James, Centipede manages to cut the stem holding the giant peach to the tree and the peach rolls away to the Atlantic Ocean with James and his friends inside it, seemingly squashing Spiker and Sponge's antique car as they try to chase it. Remembering his dream to visit New York City, James and the insects decide to go there. They use Miss Spider's silk to capture and tie a hundred seagulls to the peach stem, while battling against a giant robotic shark. They escape just in time. While flying, James and his friends eventually find themselves hungry and soon realize that \"their whole ship is made out of food\". After gorging most of the inside of the peach, Miss Spider, while using her web to tuck in James, reveals to him that she was the spider he saved from Spiker and Sponge. James then has a nightmare of him as a caterpillar attacked by Spiker, Sponge, and the rhino. When he wakes up, he and his friends find themselves in Antarctica, lost and cold. The Centipede has fallen asleep while keeping watch, resulting in them further away from their destination than ever. After hearing the Grasshoper wishing they had a compass, Centipede jumps off the peach into the icy water below and searches a sunken ship. He finds a compass but is taken prisoner by a group of skeletal pirates. James and Miss Spider rescue him and the journey continues. As the group finally reaches New York City, a storm appears. A flash of lightning reveals the rhino approaching towards them. James is terrified but faces his fears and gets his friends to safety before the rhino strikes the peach with lightning; The strings keeping the seagulls attached to the peach are cut and the peach falls to the city, dragging James with it. James coughs up the crocodile tongue as he reawakens, and emerges from the peach realizing it has landed right on top of the Empire State Building. After being rescued by the police and firefighters, Spiker and Sponge arrive, supposedly having driven their car across the seabed, and attempt to take back James and the peach. James stands up to Spiker and Sponge, and they attempt to kill James. Using the remaining seagulls, the bugs arrive in New York City. They tie up Spiker and Sponge with Miss Spider's silk and the police arrest them both. James introduces his friends and allows the children of New York to eat up the peach. The peach stone is made into a house in Central Park, where James lives with the bugs and has the friends he could wish for. Centipede runs for New York mayor, Grasshopper becomes a professional violinist, Earthworm becomes a mascot for a new cream, Ladybug becomes a nurse, Glowworm lights up the Statue of Liberty, Miss Spider owns a club called \"Spider Club\", and James celebrates his 8th birthday with his new family. In a post-credits scene, a new arcade game called \"Spike the Aunts\" is shown, featuring the rhino. \n",

            " The Inspector and Sergeant Deux-Deux are assigned to take down a notorious \"pique poquette\"  named Spider Pierre, so named because he has four arms and two legs. Their first attempt to lure him out is at a favorite watering hole of Spider Pierre, where The Inspector, after borrowing a thousand francs from Deux-Deux , goes in, flashes it around, and orders a drink. While waiting for the drink, he puts his wallet in his back pocket, where it is quickly snatched by Spider Pierre. After he drinks his drink, he goes to pay for it, and realizes his wallet was taken. The bartender then violently throws him out. Undeterred, The Inspector obtains more money from Deux-Deux  to go back in.Before Deux-Deux could tell him that the money is play money belonging to his daughter,Maria,the Inspector tells him to synch his watch,but as they go to synchronize their watches, Spider Pierre sneaks up and takes just about everything out of The Inspector's pockets , convincing him they were dealing with a vacuum cleaner. While chasing Spider Pierre through an alley, Pierre whips out his \"spider webley specialist\"  and uses it to spin a web at the other end of the alley, which slingshots The Inspector's car back all the way into the Eiffel Tower, damaging it . Later while chasing Spider Pierre on foot, Pierre sends a piece of thread to the top of a building and climbs up, followed by the Inspector, who afterwards walks on another piece of thread like a highwire, only to meet Pierre at the other end holding the other end of it. He lets go and the Inspector swings into the side of a building, taking out part of the wall. He crashes down with the wall, only to have a safe crash on him and send him through the pavement into a subway line. In the next scene, The Inspector is chasing Spider Pierre again. Pierre runs up the side of a building this time, and the Inspector tries to do so at first himself, but falls down. Undeterred again, he comes back with plungers on his feet, and starts running up the building after him. However, Pierre opens a window in the Inspector's path, and he falls into a woman's apartment, who screams and chases him out, accusing him of being a peeping Tom, then hits him over the head with a broom. When the Inspector hits the ground, he lands on the plungers, then springs back up to the woman, who hits him again. This keeps repeating, and as Deux-Deux watches, he says, \"Well, that's cop biz for you. It has its ups, and downs.\" Finally, Deux-Deux faces Spider Pierre directly and threatens to \"let him have it\" if he doesn't surrender. This prompts Pierre to laugh uncontrollably, and Deux-Deux blasts him with DDT and subdues him. Later in prison, we see that not only is Spider Pierre in there, so is the Inspector, apparently for having counterfeit money on him, as the money he borrowed from Deux-Deux was his child's play money. \n",

            " In the faraway eternally busy city of Din, live the black-and-white Rushers, who constantly go about their business in a fast-paced way and stop only to sleep. Din lies in between two worlds that create dreams to deliver to the sleeping Rushers - one is the bright and cheerful Frivoli, where Greensleeves and his Figmen of Imagination bring sweet dreams, and the other is the Murkworks, a dark and dingy factory home to vultures who drop nightmare bombs. The evil  Botch, maniacal ruler of the Murkworks wants to foil Greenie's efforts and subject the Rushers to non-stop waking nightmares. He uses his vultures to kidnap the Figs and Greensleeves, but not before Greensleeves writes an S.O.S. to Frivoli. Meanwhile, two misfits known as Ralph The All Purpose Animal , and Mumford, a Chaplin-esque mime, are put on trial for their incompetence at work. Determined to prove they can do something right, Ralph and Mumford take on the job of garbagemen. As they dump garbage over a large hill, they meet Flora Fauna, Greensleeves's niece, who has found her uncle's S.O.S and wants to find him. Botch spies on the three through Ibor, his robot gorilla, and uses Ralph and Mum's desire to be heroes to his advantage. After introducing himself as a friend of \"Greenie\", he cons the three that in order to save Greensleeves, they need to go into Din and steal the main spring from the Cosmic Clock. Flora stays behind to act the part of the damsel in distress for Botch's nightmares. Mumford and Ralph release the spring which causes time to freeze. They chase the spring throughout Din, but Botch sends his vultures to steal the spring from them and begin planting nightmare bombs. A Fairy Godmother, or FGM as she likes to be called, twinkles in to tell our heroes that they have been tricked and gives them three dimes to make a phone booth appear in case they need her help. FGM also recruits the help of the dim-witted but musclebound Rod Rescueman to aid them. Rod is more interested in rescuing Fauna, however, and abandons the boys to find her. Ralph and Mum find nightmare bombs scattered all over an office, ready to be set off by Botch once he starts time starts again. Mumford accidentally sets a bomb off and the two are trapped in a nightmare where they are chased and nearly killed by office supplies come to life. When they are finally freed from the nightmare, the Fairy Godmother transports them back to Frivoli and tells they're better off giving up after all the mistakes they've made and fires them from the hero business. This only further strengthens Ralph and Mum's resolve to do right. Meanwhile, Rod \"rescues\" Flora from the Murkworks and attempts to get a kiss from her. She tries to escape from his floating apartment in the sky and falls. She survives, however, when she lands on a mechanical serpent that attempts to stop Ralph and Mum from reaching the Murkworks. The trio and Rod storm their way in with the help of Scuzzbopper, Botch's former nightmare screenwriter, who decides to aid them after Botch destroyed his recently completed novel. Rod and Flora rescue Greenie and the Figs but have to contend with Ibor. Rod tries to save Flora again but fails, and Flora destroys the robot herself. Mum and Ralph take on Botch as the vultures fly the spring back to Din. When it seems Botch has killed Mum, Ralph finally manages to control his shapeshifting and tricks Botch into pushing \"The Big Red One\", detonating every bomb before time is restarted. Just as Botch is about to kill Ralph for ruining his plans, one last nightmare bomb appears and rolls toward Botch. Terrified at being subjected to his own nightmare, Botch leaps out the window and is carried away by his angry vultures . Ralph finds the bomb was really Mumford, who survived Botch's attack and hid in an empty shell. The two now consider themselves heroes and earn kisses from Flora. The spring returns to the Cosmic Clock of its own will, and restarts the flow of time, but at a pace where the Rushers can enjoy life. \n",

Before dying, Wong confesses to Chan that he was blackmailed by the gang into revealing their rigged hideout to Chan's team a year ago, due to the bag of money he took from Sue to pay off his debts. Fire and Sue both manage to escape the building, with Chan and Frank pursuing Fire. To distract Chan, Fire shoots at a bus driver, killing him instantly and rendering the bus full of school kids out of control. Chan quickly jumps onto the roof of the bus in an attempt to stop it. After the careening bus has caused a great deal of havoc, Chan finally manages to climb in and hit the brakes, halting it from falling into Victoria Harbour, while Frank rams a truck full of rubber ducks in front of the bus' path. After the incident, Chan discovers that Frank is not really a policeman, and confronts him. Frank attempts to explain to Chan, but Chan refuses to believe the story. Regardless, they stay together to continue to track the gang leader, Joe. They are informed by Officer Sa Sa that the gang members all come from rich families and the gang leader is actually the son of the police chief. Sue and Fire return to the gang's new hideout. Sue is badly wounded, after being shot by Frank earlier. Seeing her injury, Joe shoots and kills her. Joe's gang access Chan's police file on a computer, with Joe bent on taking revenge. Joe then arranges to meet Chan's girlfriend, Ho Yee, in the police station. He wraps a time bomb around her neck before leaving. When Chan learns of the bomb he desperately tries to free her. Ho Yee cuts the wires, with no effect, leading the police to believe that it is a fake. But when the two get ready to leave, a small wire attached to Ho Yee's back pulls out the secondary trigger, causing the bomb to explode. Before she can escape, it explodes and some falling pipes land on her, knocking her into a coma. Unfortunately for Chan, he is charged with assisting the impersonation of an officer  and for acting as an officer while under suspension. After Chan and Frank are taunted by Joe's gang, Sa Sa and her father, the jailer, release both of them illegally. The two sneak out of the police station, with everyone deliberately ignoring their escape. Police Chief Wong even makes his handgun available to Chan and tells Chan to 'bring it back when you're done'. Chan, Frank, and Sa Sa then go to a computer cafe to find teens playing the game up until they complete the most recent level to find out the gang's next target is the Bank of Hong Kong, located in the New Wing of the Convention and Exhibition Centre. A squad of police officers arrive, but this time Chan stops them from rushing in, assigning them the task of calmly escorting the public out of the building. Once the public are moved to safety, the gang members' parents are sent in, much to their surprise. One of the gang members, Max, is so ashamed of himself that he attempts to run down the escalators to his parents, only to be shot dead by Joe. Afterwards, Chan and Frank run up to engage the three remaining gang members. Frank manages to shoot Fire in the leg with his own gun, disabling him. Chan chases another gang member, Tin Tin, into a Lego exhibition. When the exhibition hall is emptied, Chan reminds him that they had struck a draw the last time they fought. The two engage in hand-to-hand combat, with Chan defeating Tin Tin. Joe then chases Frank into the hall and shoots at him. In the crossfire, Tin Tin is shot in the chest. Joe manages to chase Frank out of the room just moments before the Special Duties Unit of the police arrive. Tin Tin grabs a gun from the floor and points it at Chan's back. Chan, oblivious to what's happening behind him, calls out to the squad to bring in a medic for the Tin Tin. Contemplating what he has done and how Chan is helping him, Tin Tin decides not to shoot Chan. Chan finds Joe on the roof of the Convention Centre. Having captured and tied up Frank, Joe threatens to throw him to his death. Joe challenges Chan to a race to assemble a semi automatic pistol, a rematch of an earlier challenge, and wagering Frank's life in the process. This time, Chan chambers the bullet first thus swiftly wins the game, much to Joe's disbelief. A number of policemen arrive on the roof, along with Joe's father, the police chief. Joe's father reprimands him, while Chan tells Joe that he knows that he doesn't hate cops, he merely hates his father for berating him. Due to what Chan and his father have said, Joe finally admits defeat and deliberately unloads the single bullet in his gun and aims the empty gun at Chan for the police to have a cause to kill Joe. Not knowing that Joe's gun is empty, a police sniper then fires a round at him, injuring Joe in the process. He weeps and again aims at his father, causing the sniper to fire once more, killing him despite Chan's yelling that the gun was empty. Chan rushes to rescue Frank and both of them fall off the building. They eventually land onto a fireman's inflated cushion. In the hospital, Ho Yee has recovered and prepares to leave. She is met by several policemen and nurses who persuade her to accept Chan's marriage proposal. At first, she tries to hide her facial scars from Chan, but eventually accepts the proposal to the crowd's applause. Meanwhile, Frank is led away by Officer Sa Sa. He leaves his jacket on a railing. When Chan looks at the jacket, he suddenly recalls meeting Frank before, and has a flashback to an event from years ago: a homeless man from the mainland arrives without much money, and his son is starving. He tries to steal some food for his son from a 7-Eleven store. While running across the road to escape from the shopkeeper and the police, he is knocked down by a truck and killed. Chan arrives at the scene and uses his jacket to cover the body of the boy's father. Chan then buys the boy a loaf of bread. He comforts him, saying that the best thing do is to try to forget the past and look forward to the future. He asks the boy for his name, to which the boy replies, \"Frank Cheng\". \n",
